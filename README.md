# React Application
Simple application with React to show some GIF from [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/)

If the application doesn't work, might be because I deleted my api key, so make sure to use your own api key `src/hooks/useFetchGifs.js`

You can find this application working on https://thewasta.github.io/giphyapi-react/
